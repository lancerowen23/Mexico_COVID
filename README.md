# Wrangling and Visualizing Mexico's COVID-19 Data

Data never comes in ideal formats. For this project, I had to produce a report of Mexico's COVID-19 data in a way that compiled data on cases, deaths, suspected cases, and negative cases, all of which was served up in separate csv files on a platform that did not allow a URL connection for import. 

What's more, the wrangling process to get the data in a presentable state was intense.
